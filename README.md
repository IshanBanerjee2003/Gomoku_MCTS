# Gomoku_MCTS
In this project, I'll implement a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for the classic game of Gomoku. The base game engine is derived from this repository. Gomoku is played on a Go board with two players, one placing black pieces and the other white pieces, aiming to form an unbroken line of five pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
